# EV-Charging-Model
This agent based model, written in python, outputs energy and power demand over time for multiple vehicles across multiple households based upon pre-determined household activity

This model and its results were published in Energy Reports; Rural EV Charging: The effects of Charging Behaviour and Electricity Tariffs. Full text for which can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484723000641

All input data for the model, particularly the format of which, can be found in the folder 'Model input Data'. Based upon the activities of multiple households (49 specifically have been mapped out in the model input data), and how vehicles are used to accomplish said activities; I wanted to understand what the implications would be should all this travel be conducted by EVs instead of ICE vehicles. Two key parameters to understanding this picture that I have focused on incorporating into the model are consumer charging behaviour and grid electricity tariffs. 

The outline of the simulation process can be found below:

The focus of my work (and PhD) were rural areas of the UK, and as such the model input data reflects this, however this model could very easily be tweaked for use in different areas/countries.

This work and the corresponding publication formed part of my wider PhD, full details of which can be found here: https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/34839/
